## Features
* Compatible with Windows and Linux
* Most efficient set of arguments to run server
* Easily handle ram dedication in script
* Automatically choose to start server upon script launch
* Automatically restart when server closes/crashes
* In-app Paper.io jar download + installer

## Installation
* Requires [Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/).
* Requires [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or higher.
* Requires [PyYAML](https://pypi.org/project/PyYAML/) for server optimizer feature

Once prerequisites are installed, extract and copy the modules folder and the smcsm.py file into your Minecraft server 
directory and simply run the python script.

On Windows, double-clicking the script will open a terminal window by default,
however if it doesn't, try right clicking on the smcsm.py file and choosing open
with python

On Linux, simply navigate to the directory containing the smcsm.py file, and run with
"python3 smcsm.py"
